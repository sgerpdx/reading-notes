## HTML & CSS book  

Today's readings constitute a review of the basics of HTML structure. Of particular interest to me:

* tags wrap elements
* the body is what is visible in the main browser window
* CMS = Content Management System
* comments can be added using the <!-- --> tag
* spans are essentially inline divs
* the meta tag (in the head) is *about* the page

The *iframe* tag allows the embedding of something like a Google map; attributes allow tailoring of things such as scrollbars.

### Esccape Characters are a group of symbols, worth studying further.

HTML5 added a number of additional tags, such as *footer, header, nav, artlce, figure, aside, figcaption*

For older browsers, these elments can be specified in CSS as *display: block;*

### Design 

There are many aspects of design to consider in one's processes of developing a page, site or app; the identities and needs of the users a big part of it. Visual layout and organization are also important.

## Javascript book

This intro introduces the concept of *scripting* as instructions for how the HTML elments can be used to allow user interaction:

* objects have properties
* events allow users to interact with objects
* methods apply action (via events) or changes to objects

Note: need to study the uses of *var* in js.
